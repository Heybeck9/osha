# Defensive Security Research Agent

This microagent provides comprehensive defensive security capabilities for autonomous security research, vulnerability assessment, compliance testing, and incident response framework development.

## Capabilities

### üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Security Tools
- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated vulnerability detection in source code
- **Dependency Scanning**: Identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Configuration Auditing**: Check security configurations and hardening
- **Access Control Analysis**: Review authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Encryption Assessment**: Verify proper cryptographic implementations

### üîç Vulnerability Assessment
- **OWASP Top 10 Scanning**: Automated detection of common web vulnerabilities
- **API Security Testing**: REST/GraphQL endpoint security validation
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: Network and system vulnerability assessment
- **Container Security**: Docker/Kubernetes security analysis
- **Database Security**: SQL injection and data exposure detection

### üìã Compliance Testing
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection and privacy validation
- **SOC 2 Controls**: Security control implementation verification
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry security standards
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection compliance
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management standards

### üö® Incident Response
- **Threat Detection**: Automated anomaly and threat identification
- **Log Analysis**: Security event correlation and analysis

- **Simulation Environments**: Safe practice environments for security testing
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated security policy and procedure creation
- **Best Practices**: Security implementation guidelines and recommendations

## Ethical Guidelines

- **Defense-First Approach**: All tools focus on protection and prevention
- **Authorized Testing Only**: Requires explicit permission before security testing
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Follows coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices
- **Community Benefit**: Research outcomes shared to improve overall security
- **No Weaponization**: Tools designed to prevent rather than enable attacks

## Usage Examples

- "Perform a comprehensive security audit of this web application"
- "Generate GDPR compliance assessment for this data processing system"
- "Create incident response playbook for this infrastructure"
- "Develop security training materials for this codebase"
- "Implement security hardening for this container deployment"
